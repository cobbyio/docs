The coBuddy is a new feature that can used in the HTML editor via the robot button. 
It makes creative writing of product texts particularly easy:

- enter the desired keywords for the text
- set the desired minimum and maximum number of words

...and off you go! Similar to Chat GPT, coBuddy generates a suitable text suggestion in seconds, which you can edit, correct and adapt in terms of design in the HTML editor.
