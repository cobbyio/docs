In the cobby portal, each page now has a link to the Help Docs in the Help Center. 

<!-- truncate -->

In the upper right corner you will find the link **"Need help?"**, which will take you to the corresponding Help Center article.
For example, from the *Jobs* page, you will be directed to the appropriate "Job History & Icons" article. 
If there is no specific article for the page, you will be referred to the docs in general.
