There is now a new certificate for cobby Excel, which makes it necessary to have a specific cobby version to be able to reinstall the cobby Excel plugin if needed.

- All customers using a cobby 2nd version must therefore update to cobby version 2.4.1.12 or beta version 2.4.1.19 before reinstalling. This can be done independently via the cobby portal.

- All customers who still use a cobby 1st version, please contact the cobby team for the necessary update. We will then update cobby to version 1.59.1.1 or 1.59.1.5.
