We are happy to introduce the HTML editor, which is a great help especially for text adjustments in the shop.

- With the HTML editor you can easily convert texts into HTML or adjust existing text cells that are formatted in HTML without running the risk of breaking the HTML code and the display in the online shop.

- The editor enables much faster maintenance of product texts. Texts can be converted directly into HTML for the shop, can be easily adapted and can then be uploaded live.

- With the help of the HTML editor, you can immediately see how the text at hand would be displayed in the online shop and make adjustments as desired, such as alignment and much more.
