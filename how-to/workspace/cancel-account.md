# How to Cancel Your Account

Cancel your cobby subscription and close your account.

## Prerequisites

- Workspace owner access
- Active cobby subscription

## Before You Cancel

**Important considerations:**

- Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period
- You will retain access to cobby until the end of the paid period
- All product data and workspaces will be deleted after cancellation
- Download any data you need before cancelling
- Consider downgrading instead of cancelling if cost is a concern

## Steps

1. Log in to the cobby portal at [app.cobby.io](https://app.cobby.io).

2. Go to **Settings** → **Billing Portal**.

3. Scroll to the **cobby package** section to view your current subscription.

4. Contact support to initiate cancellation:
   - Email: support@cobby.io
   - Include your workspace name and reason for cancellation

**Result:** Support will process your cancellation request and confirm when it takes effect.

## After Cancellation

**What happens to your data:**
- Access continues until the end of your billing period
- After the period ends, your workspace and all data will be deleted
- This includes all product data, templates, and settings
- The deletion is permanent and cannot be reversed

**Reactivating your account:**
- Contact support if you change your mind before the end date
- After deletion, you will need to create a new account and reconfigure everything

## Alternatives to Cancellation

**Consider these options:**

- **Downgrade:** Switch to a lower-tier plan to reduce costs
- **Pause:** Contact support about temporary suspension options
- **Feature adjustment:** Reduce usage to stay within a lower plan tier

## Common Issues

**Cannot find cancellation option?**
- Account cancellation must be processed through support
- This ensures proper data handling and prevents accidental cancellation

**Want to cancel immediately?**
- Contact support to discuss immediate cancellation
- Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis

**Need to export data first?**
- Save all Excel workbooks with your product data
- Export any custom templates or configurations
- Document any custom attributes or settings
