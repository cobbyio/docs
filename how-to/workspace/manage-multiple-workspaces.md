## Common Issues

**Switch not working?**
- Verify both workspaces use the same cobby version
- Verify both use the same Excel plugin version
- Update both to the latest version if versions differ

**Can I use licenses from different accounts?**
- No, all licenses must belong to the same cobby account
- Contact support to consolidate licenses under one account
