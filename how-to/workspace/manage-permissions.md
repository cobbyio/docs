3. Scroll to the **Ownership** section.

4. Select the user from the drop-down menu.

5. Confirm the change.

**Result:** The selected user now has owner permissions and can access workspace settings.

## Permission Levels

- Can manage billing and subscription
- Can add/remove users
- Can transfer ownership

**Member**
- Access to cobby Excel add-in
- Can edit products and data
- Cannot access workspace settings
- Cannot manage billing

## Common Issues

- Verify the user is listed under "Manage users"
- The user must be invited to the workspace first

**Need to transfer ownership?**
- Only current owners can change ownership
- Contact support if the current owner is unavailable
