# SuperAttributeCodesRequired

### Message
Configurable super attribute codes not filled.

### Description
When creating a configurable product, the grouped attribute was forgotten to be entered but simple products were linked. The field "Configurable attributes" must not be empty for configurable products, otherwise this error appears:

### Solution
To fix the error, enter the grouped attribute and save it again.
