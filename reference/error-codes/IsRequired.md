# IsRequired

### Message
The mandatory field is empty.

### Description
Mandatory fields are declared in cobby, just like in Magento, based on the attribute configuration. 

If these are not filled in Excel, the cell is highlighted in red, so that these are immediately noticeable during editing.
If one or more mandatory fields were not filled before saving, you will receive a message from the affected products - "Attribute / is empty" in the cobby error assistant.
By clicking on the eye icon, you will be guided directly to the right product and do not have to search long.

### Solution
To fix the error, simply enter the desired value in the affected cells and save again.
